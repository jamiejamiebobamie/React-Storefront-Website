# EasyShop

This is a mockup of 'storefront' website built using **React.js**. The site arose from a class assignment that taught us how to use the Javascript functions of map, filter, and reduce.

The product names and their descriptions are all enjoyable nonsense created by the magical whimsy of our Frontend Web professor!
